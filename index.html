            <div id="exp">
              <h1>Experience</h1>
              <p>Before starting College and University, I worked at a few roles to try and help me find out what kind of future I wanted. I also worked alongside Barnardo's Works, a local employability charity that allowed me to do some volunteer work with The British Heart Foundation. This was based around electronic's repairing and stock management. I was then given the oppertunity to do Till Training with Tesco, where I was able to put my customer service skills to the test.</p>

              <h4>2013 - 2014 - ReBOOT</h4>
              <p>Computing recycling company. As part of a team, I helped with the creation of a range of Windows based desktop systems. This was a very fast paced task as the systems were contracted for local schools. As part my role, there was a range of policies involved with the testing procedures to ensure the machines were suitable for distribution. This was a good role for helping me to develop my customer service skills as I was able to deal with the deliveries with schools.</p>

              <h4>2013 - 2014 - ILM</h4>
              <p>Local electronic recycling centre. Following on from ReBOOT, I began working with a the local recycling centre. This was a great next step, as it allowed me to advance my hardware skills while still allowing me to to work with clients and customers. I handeled the dismantling of computers and laptops. This was a team based task, due to the quantity of machines we were working with and the task of sorting each system into its main components. As a drivers mate, I was tasked with going out to a range of recycling centres across Scotland to pick up and deliver all the electronic waste.</p>

              <h4>2014 - 2017 - UHI</h4>
              <p>I attended the Univerity of The Highlands and Islands in Inverness to study Computing - leaving with a HNC. This was a great addition to my studies, as I was able to gain knowledge across a broad range of studies. I worked using new skills I had never had access to before, such as the Ethical Hacking module. This involved using the OS Kali Linux, which allowed me to work using Industry recognised software. This was also a feature of my Forensics project, where we were given a crime scene and allowed to use software such as OSForensics. Following this, I worked on my Networking skills, linking this module with the creation and management of servers on my Server Management module. Web Design allowed me to create a responsive websites, using languages such as PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Modules: Ethical Hacking, Forensics, Server Management on Linux, Mobile Application Web Design, Networking, Relational Database and Web Design for desktop and mobile browsers.</p>

              <h4>2017 - Department of Work & Pensions, Summer Work Experience</h4>
              <p>As part of my primarily customer service based role, I dealt with the clients and deliveries to the office, a range of admin duties inc. filing according to Govermental standards, arranging and managing appointments/meetings and helping clients with the creation of CV’s and job applications. This was a great experience as it allowed me to focus less on the techical side of my skills, and put more work on my customer service skills and learn managerial tasks and duties as a member of a team.</p>

              <h4>2017 - Ongoing - RGU</h4>
              <p>I am currently attending Robert Gordon's University in Aberdeen to complete my BSc (Hons) Cyber Security degree. This is a big stepup from my College courses, but is allowing me to put my skills and knowledge I have gained so far to the test, and advance them to industry standards. I have been able to progress my programming skills, focusing on Object Orientated Programming using Java, this has included a recent project - Buttie Bites, a custom sandwich ordering program. I have also worked on my software development modules, creating functioning websites such as my portfolio using new techniques with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Working with my classmates on team projects, such as VMH, our Visual Media Hub, I have been able to understand how managerial roles work, pushing my communication skills, leaderships skills and time management as we were tasked and expected to work as a team would in a actual career. Our networking module, Routing & Switching, allowed us to progress our networking knowledge, working to Cisco standards. Modules include: Routing and Switching on networks, Object Orientated Programming using Java, Advanced Software Design and Development, Database Systems, Real World Project and Professional Skills, hardware using Arduinos and JavaScript.</p>
